# CharcterBERT analysis and adaptation to multitask training

Group work on CharacterBERT and its comparison to BERT in general case and medical tasks with appropriate pre-processing, for the NLP course (M2-MVA). 

The final adaptation is done applying CharacterBERT instead of BERT in a Double transfer and Multitasking pipeline.  

The code is still in work to make it clear and reusable.
